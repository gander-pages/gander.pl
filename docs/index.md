## News

::: info 2023-04-09
I was looking for a better solution to store my website content.
Originally, I assumed it would be [Decap CMS](https://decapcms.org/),
but due to the lack of [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) login support,
I opted for [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev/). I moved my archived pages to it.
The archived version of the website is available at [old.gander.pl](https://old.gander.pl/).
I still have a lot of tidying up to do.

::: info 2023-01-06
I've archived the content of my [Bolt](https://boltcms.io/)-powered site into completely
static HTML files and placed them in [this](https://github.com/gander/gander.pl-mirror-archive) repository.
I was afraid that due to not updating the code for a long time (too many changes),
someone would break into the site and turn it into a source of spam or worse.
